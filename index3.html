            Observed steady lights at high altitude at a specific location in the sky. <br>    
            <br>
            I am a Captain flying for an International Carrier based at UAE. 
            On a scheduled flight crossing Oman into the Arabian Sea 
            I observed usually strange lights at very high altitude 
            at a specific area in the sky. The lights were traveling 
            on a specific path and were very different to a usual 
            meteorite entering the atmosphere at high speed. Sometimes 
            two lights were travelling in tandem. I have never seen 
            anything like this before. I managed to record the video of 
            the lights moving. The bright light in the picture is Jupiter. 
            The faint light were the objects moving.

            Look like 1 or 3 crafts from North traveling south in tight formation. Seemed to bob up and down as they traveled. <br>
            Using a night vision camera I was able to capture on video 1 or possibly 3 objects in tight formation traveling 
            from the north going south and it seemed to bob up and down as it traveled. <br>

            At 37000 ft. Over Missouri saw 3 to 4 lights rotating around 
            each other. The lights would fade and dim. Tracked the sighting 
            for 100s of miles. Also saw 2-3 shooting star like objects 
            in the same vicinity. The rotating lights were east of the 
            Big Dipper.
